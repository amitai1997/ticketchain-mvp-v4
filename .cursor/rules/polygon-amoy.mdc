Cursor Rules – Polygon Amoy

Network Setup
	•	Configure RPC: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology with chainId = 80002.
	•	Add Amoy in wallet using JSON-RPC details, not preset networks.
	•	Pin public RPC endpoints; fallback to private node when throughput critical.
	•	Use gas price oracle; avoid fixed gas values.

Tokens & Faucet
	•	Acquire test MATIC via official Amoy faucet after GitHub OAuth.
	•	Request small amounts; respect faucet cooldown rules.
	•	Transfer test MATIC between dev wallets to simulate user flows.
	•	Never purchase or sell test tokens; they hold no value.

Deployment & Testing
	•	Compile contracts with Solidity 0.8.x and optimizer on 200 runs.
	•	Deploy via Hardhat/Foundry using Amoy network config.
	•	Verify contracts automatically on Amoy block explorer.
	•	Run integration tests on forked Amoy state for realism.

Bridge & Interoperability
	•	Bridge assets from Goerli using Polygon PoS bridge test environment.
	•	Confirm checkpoints finality before relying on bridged balances.
	•	Monitor cross-chain events; handle duplicate mint or burn gracefully.

Monitoring & Maintenance
	•	Track RPC status, block lag, and gas spikes via explorer APIs.
	•	Rotate dev keys; treat testnet keys with same hygiene as mainnet.
	•	Clean up orphan test contracts monthly to reduce clutter.
