**Purpose & Clarity**

* Explain code intent and rationale, not obvious implementation.
* Use domain terminology consistently for clearer context.
* Avoid redundant comments that just restate code.

**Format & Style**

* Begin inline comment two spaces after statement.
* Capitalize first letter; end sentences with period.
* Separate block comments with preceding blank line.
* Use # TODO or # FIXME with initials and date.

**Docstring Structure**

* Enclose docstrings in triple double quotes.
* Start with concise summary line ending with period.
* Follow summary with blank line then details paragraph.
* List Args, Returns, Raises using Google style headers.
* Provide type hints inline with parameter descriptions.
* Include usage example or doctest when helpful.

**Coverage & Maintenance**

* Document every public module, class, function, method.
* Update comments and docstrings with every functional change.
* Delete obsolete comments during refactors.

**Tooling & Automation**

* Run pydocstyle, flake8-docstrings, or equivalent in CI.
