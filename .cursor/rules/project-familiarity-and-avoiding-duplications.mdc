# Cursor Rules â€“ Assistant Project Familiarity & Duplication Prevention

**Context Loading**

* Index entire codebase symbols, configs, and dependencies before any modification.
* Parse open PRs and feature branches to detect parallel changes.
* Ingest project documentation, ADRs, READMEs for domain context.
* Detect framework versions and coding conventions automatically.

**Impact Analysis**

* Resolve referenced identifiers to confirm existing definitions.
* Trace call graph to identify affected modules.
* Review test coverage gaps in impacted areas.
* Surface potential conflicting TODOs or technical debt.

**Code Generation & Reuse**

* Prefer extending existing abstractions over introducing new classes.
* Reuse helper utilities when functional overlap exceeds 70%.
* Consolidate duplicated logic into shared modules.
* Generate patches small and atomic per concern.

**Quality Gates**

* Run duplicate-code scanners on proposed diff pre-commit.
* Block commit if duplication metric exceeds configured threshold.
* Auto-run linter, formatter, and unit tests for changed files.
* Require developer approval for any new dependency introduction.

**Continuous Learning**

* Incrementally retrain code index on merged commits daily.
* Log prompt, rationale, and diff for auditability.
* Collect duplication trend metrics and suggest refactor tasks.
