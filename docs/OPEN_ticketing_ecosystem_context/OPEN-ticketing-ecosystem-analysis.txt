Report on the OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem: Architecture, API, and Protocol Analysis


Executive Summary

This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem, based on its API reference and system guides. The ecosystem presents a dual-faceted architecture: a developer-friendly, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) layer known as the Ticket Engine, and a sophisticated on-chain economic protocol built on Polygon. The Ticket Engine is designed for seamless integration, abstracting the complexities of blockchain interactions through a simple HTTP API that allows ticketing companies to create "digital twins" of their existing inventory as ERC-721 NFTs without overhauling their primary infrastructure.1
The system's economy is powered by the OPN token, which functions as "fuel" for all on-chain transactions.1 A key architectural feature is the decoupling of operational costs from token volatility; fees are denominated in USD and the OPN/USD exchange rate is fixed at the time of an integrator's top-up, providing predictable pricing.1 The ticket lifecycle is managed through a series of asynchronous actions submitted via a unified
/stream endpoint, a design that favors event-driven architectures common in the ticketing industry.1
However, the documentation contains a critical ambiguity regarding the platform's underlying blockchain. While all technical specifications, smart contract addresses, and API endpoints explicitly reference the Polygon network, the guides state the protocol is actively migrating to the Sophon blockchain.1 This lack of documented technical details for Sophon presents a significant strategic and developmental risk for any new integrator, making the current documentation an unreliable guide for future-proof implementation.

Part I: System Architecture and Core Concepts

This part establishes the foundational understanding of the ecosystem's architecture, key entities, and the asynchronous communication model that underpins all interactions.

1.1 The Ticket Engine: An Abstraction for On-Chain Ticketing

The OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem's primary interface for developers and integrators is the Ticket Engine. It is positioned as a service layer that abstracts away the inherent complexities of direct blockchain interaction, such as transaction management, gas fee optimization, and state guarantees.1 The documentation emphasizes that writing data to a blockchain directly presents a "serious challenge and software expertise orthogonal to building successful ticketing software".1 By providing a simple HTTP API, the Ticket Engine handles these lower-level implementation details, including intelligent transaction batching and gas pricing algorithms, allowing integrators to focus on their core business logic.1
This design effectively positions the Ticket Engine as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. Rather than interacting directly with a set of open, permissionless smart contracts, integrators become consumers of a managed service. This model significantly lowers the barrier to entry for web2-native companies but also introduces a dependency on the OPEN infrastructure for uptime, performance, and continued service.
A core philosophy of the Ticket Engine is the concept of the digital twin. The system is designed to complement and augment an integrator's existing infrastructure, not replace it. An integrator can "twin" their primary ticket inventory by creating a parallel, blockchain-native NFT copy for each ticket sold.1 This allows them to explore the benefits of web3—such as on-chain provenance, secondary market potential, and post-event fan engagement through collectibles—without incurring operational risk or needing to migrate their primary source of truth.1

1.2 Core On-Chain and Off-Chain Entities

The ecosystem is built around a set of core data models that represent the ticketing domain. These entities are manipulated via the Ticket Engine API and have both on-chain and off-chain representations.
●	Events: An Event represents a real-world or virtual occasion. Programmatically, it is the parent entity that contains a collection of tickets. A key architectural decision is that each Event created via the newEvent action results in the deployment of a new, unique smart contract on the blockchain. This gives each event its own namespaced NFT collection and a distinct on-chain address, which can be used with third-party tools like block explorers and marketplaces.1 The
eventId is a client-side generated string (up to 255 characters) that must be unique to the integrator and is used as the reference key for all subsequent API calls related to that event.1 This
eventId itself is not stored on-chain; it is an off-chain identifier for the Ticket Engine's use.
●	Tickets: A Ticket defines a right of access to an event and is represented on-chain as an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT).1 This adherence to the ERC-721 standard (Ethereum Foundation, 09/2025) ensures composability with the broader web3 ecosystem, including wallets and marketplaces like OpenSea.1 Each ticket is associated with an event via its
eventId property. The state of a ticket evolves through a defined lifecycle of actions, such as soldTicket, scannedTicket, and checkedInTicket.1
●	Metadata: This refers to the descriptive data attached to an NFT ticket, which gives it its unique characteristics, such as name, description, and image. The system is compatible with the OpenSea Metadata Standard (OpenSea, 07/2025), which facilitates rich display in major marketplaces.1 While some metadata can be about the event itself, it is most commonly used to define the NFT's media content. Integrators are responsible for hosting the actual media assets (e.g., JPG, MP4) and providing a URI reference to them.1
●	Users: The system employs a pragmatic identity model that bridges web2 and web3 concepts. An end-user is primarily identified by a userId, which is a client-side identifier created and managed by the integrator.1 This
userId is not stored on-chain and serves as a stable reference within the integrator's own system. This design allows a traditional ticketing company to onboard its existing user base without immediately requiring them to have or manage a crypto wallet.
●	Wallets: The ecosystem supports a dual-wallet model. Tickets are initially minted into a custodial environment managed by the protocol, associated with the integrator's userId. The claimedTicket action serves as the explicit mechanism to transfer the NFT from this custodial state to a user's personal, non-custodial wallet, which is specified via a blockchain address in the to field.1 This optional off-ramp into true self-custody provides flexibility, catering to both crypto-native and non-native consumers.

1.3 The Asynchronous Confirmation Model (HIGH PRIORITY)

A critical architectural consideration for any integrator is the system's asynchronous nature. Due to the public and competitive environment of blockchains like Polygon, transaction confirmation times are variable and cannot be guaranteed within a standard HTTP request-response cycle.1 The Ticket Engine API is explicitly designed around this constraint.
When an integrator submits one or more actions to the /stream endpoint, the API provides an immediate synchronous response. For each successfully queued action, this response contains a unique actionPromise—a UUID that represents a "promise on the confirmation of a given action".1 This
actionPromise acts as a vital correlation ID, linking the initial API call to a future, asynchronous blockchain event.
Integrators must implement one of two mechanisms to receive the final confirmation, which includes the blockchain transaction hash (txHash), the eventAddress of the smart contract, and the tokenId of the NFT:
1.	Polling: The integrator can periodically query the GET /actions/{promise} endpoint. The response will detail the current status of the action (e.g., pending, confirmed, error).1 The documentation recommends implementing a back-off strategy to avoid excessive requests and rate-limiting issues.1
2.	Webhooks / Callbacks: This is the recommended method for real-time systems. When creating an event, the integrator can specify a callbackUrl.1 When the status of any action related to that event is updated (e.g., a ticket mint is confirmed), the Ticket Engine will send a POST request to this HTTPS-secured URL. The payload of this callback contains the
actionPromise ID, signaling to the integrator's system that it should now query the /actions endpoint to fetch the updated data.1
This asynchronous model is an architectural imperative. Any integrating system must be designed to be event-driven or capable of managing stateful, long-running processes. A simple synchronous request-response architecture is insufficient. The integrator is responsible for storing the actionPromise and implementing a robust listener (either a webhook endpoint or a polling service) to handle the eventual outcome of the requested blockchain operation.

Part II: API Integration Deep Dive

This part provides a granular analysis of the key API endpoints and data flows that an integrator must implement to interact with the OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem.

2.1 Authentication and Authorization Flows (HIGH PRIORITY)

The ecosystem employs two distinct and segregated authentication mechanisms, a design that enhances security by separating integrator-level permissions from user-level permissions.
1.	Integrator API Key (X-Api-Key): All primary API interactions with the Ticket Engine—such as submitting actions to /stream or querying /actions—are authenticated using a static API key. This key must be passed in the X-Api-Key header of every request.1 Separate, unique keys are provided for the
Playground and Production environments. The documentation advises storing these keys securely as secrets outside of the codebase, for example, in environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager.1 An invalid or missing key will result in a
403 Forbidden response.1 This key authenticates the
integrator as a trusted entity with permission to perform broad system operations.
2.	User JWT (Bearer Token): A different authentication model is used for the wallet-signing functionality. The POST /wallet/sign endpoint, which is used to sign messages with a user's custodial wallet for features like Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), requires an Authorization: Bearer <JWT> header.1 This JSON Web Token is user-specific and short-lived. It can be obtained by making a request to the
GET /wallet/generate_token endpoint, which itself is authenticated with the integrator's X-Api-Key.1 The generated JWT is valid for only 15 minutes and can only be used once, preventing replay attacks.1 The JWT payload contains claims identifying the user (
id, id_type) and the integrator (iss), effectively delegating signing authority for a specific user for a brief period.
This segregation of authentication methods is a robust security practice. It ensures that an integrator's powerful, long-lived API key cannot be used to directly perform actions on behalf of an end-user, such as signing messages. The short-lived JWT provides a secure mechanism for an application to request a signature from the custodial wallet service without ever exposing private keys.

2.2 The /stream Endpoint: The Unified Action Channel (HIGH PRIORITY)

The cornerstone of the Ticket Engine API is the POST /stream endpoint. It is the single, unified channel for submitting all state-changing operations to the protocol. This design choice was made explicitly to align with the event-driven architectures and message queues commonly used by commercial ticketing applications.1
The endpoint accepts a JSON array of action objects, allowing for mixed batches of operations to be sent in a single HTTP request. Actions are processed sequentially in the order they appear in the array, and a single request can contain up to 5,000 actions.1 This batching capability is highly efficient for high-volume scenarios, as it reduces network overhead and allows integrators to forward events from their internal systems with minimal transformation.
The primary actions supported by the /stream endpoint are detailed in the table below. For each action, the API reference provides comprehensive schemas defining required, exclusive, and optional fields, along with data types, validation rules, and an indicator of whether the data is persisted on-chain.1 A critical dependency is that a
newEvent action must be submitted and queued before any ticket-related actions for that eventId can be processed.1

Action Name	Purpose	Key Identifier(s)	Effect on Lifecycle	Is Billed?	Reference
newEvent	Creates a new event smart contract and its on-chain collection.	eventId	Initializes event.	No	1
updateEvent	Updates on-chain metadata for an existing event.	eventId	Modifies event data.	No	1
soldTicket	Mints a new NFT ticket for a specific event.	eventId, ticketId	Creates NFT, starts lifecycle.	Yes	1
resoldTicket	Logs a secondary sale event on the ticket.	ticketId or nftId	Logs resale interaction.	Yes (Premium)	1
scannedTicket	Registers a non-finalizing scan (e.g., for multi-entry).	ticketId or nftId	Logs scan interaction.	No (Basic)	1
checkedInTicket	Registers a finalizing scan, marking the ticket as used.	ticketId or nftId	Finalizes state, enables claim.	No (Basic)	1
invalidatedTicket	Finalizes the ticket's state as invalid (e.g., cancelled).	ticketId or nftId	Finalizes state, blocks claim.	No (Basic)	1
claimedTicket	Transfers the NFT to a user's external wallet.	ticketId or nftId	Transfers ownership to user.	No (Basic)	1
updateTicket	Changes the NFT's off-chain metadata URI (e.g., image).	ticketId or nftId	Modifies NFT metadata pointer.	No	1

2.3 Querying System State: GET Endpoints and the Subgraph

While the /stream endpoint handles all write operations, a set of GET endpoints is provided for retrieving specific data. These are primarily for operational, targeted lookups.
●	GET /actions/{promise}: As detailed in Part I, this is used to poll for the status of a single, specific asynchronous operation.1
●	GET /metadata/{blockchainHumanId}/{eventIndex}/{tokenId}: This endpoint returns the public JSON metadata for a single NFT, structured according to the OpenSea standard. It follows a fallback logic for the image URL, prioritizing the ticket-specific imageUrl, then the event-level defaultNftImageUrl, and finally a generic placeholder image.1
●	GET /user/id/{userId} and GET /user/uuid/{userUuid}: These endpoints provide a user-centric view of the data, returning a payload that lists the user's associated wallets and the tickets they contain, both in custodial and non-custodial (custom) wallets.1
However, for any form of complex data retrieval, analytics, or building a rich front-end application, the documentation consistently directs developers to use the OPN Ticketing Ecosystem Subgraph.1 The Subgraph, hosted on The Graph, indexes all on-chain data in real-time and exposes it via a powerful GraphQL API. The documentation even provides example GraphQL queries for fetching event and ticket data, underscoring its importance.1
This indicates a clear separation of concerns in the system's query capabilities. The REST API is for simple, key-based lookups of operational data. The Subgraph is the true analytical and comprehensive query layer. An integrator planning to build any data-intensive features must therefore be prepared to work with GraphQL, which represents a distinct technical skill set and integration pattern from the REST API.

Part III: Economic and Protocol Mechanics

This part analyzes the on-chain smart contracts and tokenomic model that underpin the Ticket Engine's functionality. The mechanics are designed to provide predictable costs for integrators while creating a sustainable, revenue-generating protocol.

3.1 The OPN Token and Fuel-Based Economy

The OPN token is the native utility token of the ecosystem and functions as the "fuel" required for every ticket-related transaction that writes to the blockchain.1 The economic model is built around a unique pricing mechanism designed to shield integrators from the price volatility common to crypto assets.
All fees and accounting within the protocol are denominated in USD.1 When an integrator tops up their account, the USD value of that top-up is recorded, and the price of OPN is fixed at that moment for their account.1 For example, if an integrator tops up with
$1,000 worth of OPN, their account is credited with a $1,000 balance. The amount of OPN consumed per subsequent transaction is then calculated based on the USD-denominated fee for that action and this fixed, historical OPN price. The formula is effectively costOPN=costUSD/priceOPN_at_topup.1 This architecture decouples the integrator's operational costs from the live market volatility of the OPN token, a critical feature for attracting and retaining traditional, non-crypto-native businesses who require predictable P&L models.
The protocol distinguishes between two classes of billable interactions:
●	Basic Interactions: This category includes the standard lifecycle events of a ticket after it has been sold: scanned, checked-in, invalidated, and claimed. The OPN fuel required for all of these actions is pre-paid and reserved at the moment the ticket is first minted (soldTicket).1 The cost is determined by the
primaryRate set for the integrator.
●	Premium Interactions: This currently refers to the resoldTicket action, which logs a secondary sale. This action is not funded from the initially reserved fuel. Instead, it incurs an additional charge that is deducted directly from the integrator's main Available Fuel balance at the time of the transaction.1 The documentation notes that this is not billed for API-only customers and will be enabled alongside a forthcoming decentralized secondary marketplace product with Immutable X.1

3.2 On-Chain Accounting: The Flow of Available, Reserved, and Spent Fuel

The Economics.sol smart contract manages all on-chain accounting through a three-bucket system that tracks the flow of OPN fuel through the protocol.1 This system provides a transparent and auditable trail of capital from integrator top-up to protocol revenue collection.
1.	Available Fuel: This is the integrator's main account balance, representing their pre-funded working capital. It is topped up via the Integrator Dashboard and is the source of funds for minting new tickets and paying for premium interactions.1
2.	Reserved Fuel: When a ticket is minted (soldTicket), the calculated cost in OPN is deducted from the integrator's Available Fuel and moved into the Reserved Fuel balance. This capital is now escrowed and committed to funding the future basic interactions for that specific ticket. It cannot be used to mint other tickets.1
3.	Spent Fuel: Once a ticket's lifecycle is finalized (i.e., it is checkedIn or invalidated), any remaining OPN in its Reserved Fuel allocation is transferred to the Spent Fuel balance. This balance represents the protocol's accrued revenue, which is now ready to be collected and distributed to its destination addresses (e.g., the DAO treasury, staking rewards pool) via the FuelCollector.collect() function.1
A notable mechanism within this flow is the Basic Tax Rate. To avoid having large amounts of capital locked in Reserved Fuel for long-duration events, basic interactions like scanned are "taxed" a percentage (e.g., 20%) of the fuel that was initially reserved. This taxed amount is immediately moved from Reserved Fuel to Spent Fuel, ensuring a more continuous and predictable revenue stream for the protocol rather than waiting for a single payout at the end of the ticket's life.1

3.3 The Smart Contract Constellation (Polygon)

The OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem is powered by a suite of interconnected smart contracts deployed on the Polygon network. The architecture is designed to be modular and upgradeable, primarily through the use of a central registry and proxy patterns. The documentation provides the addresses for these core contracts, allowing for independent verification on a block explorer like Polygonscan.1
The architecture demonstrates foresight in its design for long-term maintainability. The Registry contract acts as a service locator, or a "hub," allowing the protocol's other contracts ("spokes") to be upgraded or replaced without requiring a full system redeployment. The use of the BeaconProxy pattern for event contracts is particularly efficient; it allows the logic for all event contracts to be upgraded simultaneously by pointing the beacon to a new EventImplementation contract. While this provides flexibility, it also centralizes a degree of control with the owner of the Registry and the Beacon, who holds the authority to upgrade the system's core logic.
The table below serves as a directory for the key on-chain components on Polygon.

Part IV: Staking, Governance, and the Developer Ecosystem

This part covers the components that support the core protocol, including the staking system that underpins the token's value, the developer tools for integration and testing, and the user-facing dashboards.

4.1 Staking Mechanics and the xOPN Vault

The OPN staking system is designed to align the incentives of token holders with the long-term success of the protocol, while also providing a mechanism for governance participation. The system is implemented as a tokenized vault that adheres to the ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults (Ethereum Foundation, 03/2025), a standard for yield-bearing vaults.1
When a user deposits OPN into the vault, they receive xOPN, a separate ERC-20 token that represents their share of the vault's total assets. The xOPN token is a yield-bearing asset; as the vault accrues rewards, the amount of OPN that each xOPN can be redeemed for increases. The OPN/xOPN exchange rate can therefore only increase over time.1
Rewards distributed to the staking vault come from four primary sources 1:
1.	Ticketing Fees: A percentage of the Spent Fuel from ticketing activity is directed to the staking vault.
2.	Trading Fees: A portion of fees collected from protocol-owned liquidity pools.
3.	Instant Withdrawal Fees: Fees paid by stakers who choose to withdraw their assets without waiting for the lockup period to end.
4.	Redistributed Rewards: When a user initiates a standard withdrawal, their tokens are locked and cease earning rewards. The rewards that these locked tokens would have accrued are redistributed among the remaining active stakers.
The withdrawal mechanisms are structured to heavily incentivize long-term holding and reduce token velocity:
●	Standard Withdrawal: This is a two-step process. A user first creates a withdrawal request, which locks their xOPN and fixes the redemption rate. This begins a 26-week (6-month) maturity period. After this period, the user can execute the withdrawal to receive their OPN without any fee. The request can be cancelled at any time, but the locked xOPN does not accrue rewards.1
●	Instant Withdrawal: A user can bypass the lockup period and withdraw their OPN at any time by paying a significant fee (currently set at 15%). This fee is not burned but is instead distributed among the remaining stakers in the vault, directly increasing their yield.1
For governance, voting power is determined by the amount of underlying OPN held within the staking contract, not the amount of xOPN held in a user's wallet. This voting power must be explicitly activated by the user through a delegation transaction.1

4.2 Developer Tooling and Environments

The ecosystem provides a suite of tools and distinct environments to facilitate development, testing, and public transparency.
●	Environments: Two parallel environments are offered for all major components. The Playground environment (engine.play.onopen.xyz) is a sandbox for integration testing. It writes transactions to the public mainnet to provide a realistic experience but is unmetered and not billed.1 The
Production environment (engine.onopen.xyz) is optimized for high-volume, live events and requires the integrator's account to be funded.1 Each environment requires a separate API key.1
●	Integrator Dashboard: This is a web-based portal for integrators to manage their account, view usage statistics, see created events and their contract addresses, top up their fuel balance, and set low-balance alerts.1
●	Ticket Explorer: This is a public-facing website (explore.onopen.xyz) that acts as a transparent gateway to view all tickets and events registered on the protocol. It allows anyone to see the timeline and on-chain history of an individual ticket using its nftId, browse platform statistics, and view claimed collectibles.1 It serves as a powerful tool for end-users and partners to independently verify the authenticity and status of any ticket.
●	Subgraphs: As previously noted, the protocol relies heavily on The Graph for data indexing and querying. Two separate subgraphs are provided: the Ticket Subgraph for all protocol usage and ticketing data, and the Token Subgraph for staking-related information (deposits, withdrawals, etc.). Both are available for Playground and Production, and on both Polygon and Ethereum, exposing all on-chain data via a public GraphQL API.1 This commitment to open, queryable data fosters community development and allows third parties to build applications on top of the OPEN data layer.

5.3 Open Questions and Documentation Gaps

A thorough review of the provided documentation reveals several critical ambiguities, inconsistencies, and gaps. These issues present significant risks to any developer or organization considering integration with the OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem and require immediate clarification from the document authors.
1.	CRITICAL: The Polygon to Sophon Migration Ambiguity
○	The Contradiction: The "OPN Ticketing Contracts" and "Ticket Explorer" guides explicitly state that the protocol is "in the process of moving all our ticketing volume to the Sophon blockchain" and that "OPN Ticketing Ecosystem is migrating from Polygon to Sophon".1 However, every piece of actionable technical information in both documents—including all API endpoints, smart contract addresses, Subgraph links, and code examples—points exclusively to the Polygon mainnet.1 External research confirms Sophon is a ZK-chain focused on entertainment and gaming, with its mainnet having launched in late 2024, but provides no specific details on the OPEN migration.8
○	Impact: This is a fundamental and show-stopping contradiction. A developer has no clear direction on which blockchain to target for a new integration. Building on Polygon infrastructure that is slated for deprecation is a waste of resources and introduces significant future migration risk. The complete absence of technical documentation for Sophon makes development on the purported target chain impossible.
○	Clarifying Questions:
■	What is the official, current status and timeline for the Sophon migration?
■	Are the Polygon contracts and API endpoints (engine.onopen.xyz) considered legacy? If so, what is the deprecation schedule?
■	Where is the complete technical documentation for the Sophon environment, including API endpoints, smart contract addresses, Subgraph URLs, and any necessary SDKs?
■	What is the defined migration path for integrators and assets currently on Polygon?
2.	Vague Secondary Market Integration with Immutable X
○	The Gap: The "Interactions & Dynamic Pricing" guide mentions an "immutable X decentralised secondary marketplace product" as an optional, premium feature.1 This is the sole reference to what would be a major piece of functionality. There is no information on the API, the user flow, or the commercial model. External research shows Immutable X is a prominent L2 for NFTs, but provides no link to this specific integration.10
○	Impact: A robust secondary market is a key value proposition for NFT ticketing. The lack of any technical or operational details makes it impossible for an integrator to evaluate or plan for this feature.
○	Clarifying Questions:
■	Is the Immutable X secondary marketplace integration currently live and available to integrators?
■	What are the specific API actions, endpoints, or SDKs required to interact with this marketplace (e.g., listing a ticket for sale, processing a sale)?
■	How is this premium feature enabled and billed for an integrator's account?
3.	Manual Operational Processes and Bottlenecks
○	The Issue: The documentation states that API key rotation is a manual process requiring contact with support.1 Similarly, topping up an account via bank transfer requires direct contact with the team.1
○	Impact: These manual dependencies introduce operational friction and potential delays that are unsuitable for scalable, automated systems. They present a business continuity risk if support is unavailable.
○	Clarifying Questions:
■	What are the service-level agreements (SLAs) for manual key rotation and invoice-based top-ups?
■	What is the current development status and estimated delivery date for the self-service key rotation feature mentioned as "currently being worked on"?1
4.	Inconsistent Branding and Terminology
○	The Issue: The documentation inconsistently uses the names "GET Protocol," "OPN Ticketing Ecosystem," and "OPEN" across both documents and in diagrams.1 Dashboard screenshots still show "GET Protocol" and refer to the token as "GET," while the text refers to the "OPN" token and "xOPN" staking token.1 External research confirms a rebrand from GET Protocol to OPEN Ticketing Ecosystem occurred.12
○	Impact: This creates confusion for developers regarding correct branding, naming conventions, and official token symbols, which is important for user-facing text and internal code.
○	Clarifying Questions:
■	What are the official and final names for the protocol, the legal entity, and the utility token that should be used in all new integrations?
■	Are the dashboard UI and older documentation sections scheduled to be updated to reflect the new branding?
5.	Insufficient Error Handling Documentation
○	The Issue: The API reference lists high-level HTTP status codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden) but lacks a comprehensive guide to the business-logic errors that can occur within a 200 OK response from the /stream endpoint. For example, the specific error payload for attempting an invalid action (like reselling a checked-in ticket) is not documented. The wont_broadcast status is the only clue that such validation exists.1
○	Impact: Without a detailed error schema, developers cannot build robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms. They are left to discover these errors through trial and error.
○	Clarifying Questions:
■	Can a comprehensive list or schema of action-specific error codes and messages be provided for actions submitted to the /stream endpoint?
■	What is the exact JSON structure of the error object for a failed action within a batch response?
